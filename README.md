# Wine-Quality-Prediction
•Leveraged scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
•Prepared the wine dataset by addressing missing values and encoding categorical variables.
•Identified relevant features through correlation analysis and feature importance.
•Implemented a decision tree classifier algorithm for classification tasks.
•Trained the classifier model on the preprocessed data.
•Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy and F1-score.
•Visualized decision boundaries and feature importance using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
•Deployed the trained decision tree classifier for wine quality prediction, aiding winemakers in assessing wine batches.
