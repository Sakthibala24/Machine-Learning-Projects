# Wine Quality Prediction Project
## Overview
This project aims to predict wine quality using machine learning techniques. Leveraging the scikit-learn library along with NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the goal is to assist winemakers in evaluating the quality of wine batches.

## Tools and Libraries Used
* scikit-learn
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
## Key Steps
### 1. Data Preprocessing :
Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables in the wine dataset.

### 2. Feature Selection :
Identified relevant features using correlation analysis and feature importance techniques.

### 3. Model Implementation :
Utilized a decision tree classifier algorithm from scikit-learn for classification tasks.

### 4. Model Training :
Trained the decision tree classifier on the preprocessed dataset.

### 5. Model Evaluation :
Assessed classifier performance using metrics such as accuracy and F1-score.

### 6. Visualization :
Visualized decision boundaries and feature importance using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

### 7. Deployment :
Deployed the trained model for wine quality prediction, aiding winemakers in assessing wine batches.
